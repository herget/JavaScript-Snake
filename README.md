# Retro Snake Game - Recreating my Game from 2001

I've rebuilt my snake game from the year 2001. The new game works on all modern browsers and even using gestures on mobile devices. Just swipe to move the snake in various directions.

## 15 hours from the idea to play the final game

My first ever snake game was running on a TI92plus calculator. It's still [online](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/210/21090.html) after almost 20 years!

My goal was to rebuild it for modern browsers. It should match the retro design with a green monochrome background.

## Research, fork, add retro design, and gestures

Thankfully, I did not have to recode all of the snake logic. I've forked the project from [patorjk](https://github.com/patorjk/JavaScript-Snake).

__Some of the enhancements I did:__

- 👋 Integrated Hammer.js to enable gestures
- ⚡️ GitHub actions: Every commit will be pushed to the live GitHub pages site.
- #️⃣ Introduced a custom font to make it really retro.
- 💅 Packaged tailwindcss to quickly design it.
- 🐍 Added a snakehead, to match my design from 2001.
